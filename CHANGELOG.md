## Version 0.0.4 - 2024-08-16

- Updated documentation to reflect the new API key format and generation process.

### Important
- Users need to sign up on https://trackmoney.crediometer.com/ to generate their new API key.
- Existing integrations using phone numbers as API keys will need to be updated to the new API key format.
